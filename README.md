Pitch: 

WeTail is a single-page application that contains all-things related to cocktails. WeTail provides a community for users to look up cocktails, post their own recipes, as well as rate and review cocktails.

User Stories:

-As a user, I can search for a cocktail by name. Results will pull up images of cocktails, and I can click on the image to view the ingredients and recipe for the cocktail.
-As a user, I can navigate through cocktail categories (by alcohol, by type of drink, alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic)
-As a user, I can post cocktail creations
-As a user, I can post reviews, including rating and descriptions as well as “liking” individual reviews.
When the page first loads, as a user, I can view popular drinks.
