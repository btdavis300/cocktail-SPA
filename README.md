Pitch: 

WeTail is a single-page application that contains all-things related to cocktails. WeTail provides a community for users to look up cocktails, post their own recipes, as well as rate and review cocktails.



User Stories:

-When the page first loads, as a user, I can browse through cocktails. I can click on thumbnails of cocktails, then view a bigger image of the cocktail, along with its name, list of ingredients, and how to make the cocktail.

-As a user, I can search for a cocktail by name. I can view the conents at the top of the page.

-As a user, I can navigate through cocktail categories (by alcohol, by type of drink, alcoholic vs. non-alcoholic)

-As a user, I can post cocktail creations. My creation will be displayed on top of the page, and I can also view it in the list of cocktails in the browse section.

-I can click a button to scroll back to the top of the page.
